# CloudBurst Terminal Logs Examples

This document provides real terminal output examples from CloudBurst operations, with sensitive information sanitized and detailed explanations of what's happening at each step.

## üîí Sanitized Information

The following sensitive data has been replaced for security:
- **AWS Instance IDs**: `i-0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` 
- **Public IPs**: `x.xxx.xxx.xxx`
- **File paths**: `/path/to/project/` instead of actual user paths
- **UUIDs**: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

## üìä Example 1: Single Scene Processing

This example shows processing one 27-second Chinese video with subtitles and zoom effects.

### Key Metrics:
- **Input**: 1 scene (27-second audio + image + subtitles)
- **Total Time**: 155.9 seconds (2.6 minutes)
- **Cost**: $0.021 (about 2 cents)
- **Output**: 7.2MB MP4 video

### Terminal Output:
```

### Time Breakdown Explanation:

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Instance Creation** | 0-10s | AWS provisions the EC2 instance |
| **Docker Setup** | 10-75s | Docker container with video generation API loads |
| **Video Processing** | 75-156s | Actual video generation (80.6s for 27s video) |
| **File Download** | 156-161s | Download 7.2MB video from instance |
| **Instance Termination** | 161-162s | Clean shutdown to stop billing |

### Cost Analysis:
- **Hourly Rate**: $0.475/hour for c5.2xlarge
- **Total Runtime**: 2.65 minutes
- **Final Cost**: $0.021 (2.65 min √ó $0.475/60)

## üìä Example 2: Parallel Batch Processing (Expected Output)

This example shows what you'll see when running the parallel test with 2 scenes on 2 instances.

### Expected Metrics:
- **Input**: 2 scenes (scene_015 and scene_021)
- **Instances**: 2 (running in parallel)
- **Expected Time**: ~160-180 seconds (similar to single scene due to parallelism)
- **Expected Cost**: ~$0.04-0.05 (2x the single scene cost)
- **Speedup**: ~2x faster than sequential processing

### Expected Terminal Output:
```
~/project % python3 test_cloudburst_parallel_two_instances.py
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will create 2 AWS EC2 instances and incur charges!
   Estimated cost: ~$0.04-0.05 for 2 scenes on 2 instances

üîÑ PARALLEL PROCESSING: Each instance will process 1 scene simultaneously
   This tests the execute_parallel_batches function

üñ•Ô∏è  Instance Details:
   - Batch 1: 1 scenes, $0.0208, c5.2xlarge
   - Batch 2: 1 scenes, $0.0212, c5.2xlarge

‚úÖ Test completed!
```

### Parallel Processing Benefits:

1. **Time Savings**: 
   - Sequential: ~320 seconds (160s √ó 2)
   - Parallel: ~165 seconds (only slightly more than 1 scene)
   - Savings: ~155 seconds (48% faster)

2. **Cost Implications**:
   - Same total compute time, same total cost
   - But results delivered much faster

3. **Scalability**:
   - 10 scenes on 10 instances: Still ~165 seconds
   - 100 scenes on 20 instances: Still ~165-200 seconds
   - Linear cost, logarithmic time

## üîç Log Analysis Guide

### Understanding Timestamps:
- `[08:44:00.763]`: Actual wall clock time
- `+ 0.00s`: Elapsed time since start
- Both help track performance and identify bottlenecks

### Key Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Success markers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (non-fatal)
- ‚ùå Errors (operation failed)
- üì• Download operations
- üí∞ Cost tracking
- ‚è±Ô∏è Performance metrics

### Cost Monitoring:
1. **Current estimated cost**: Cost before downloads
2. **FINAL COST**: Total cost including all operations
3. Always shows 6 decimal places for accuracy

### Instance States:
1. **Creating**: AWS provisioning resources
2. **Running**: Instance is active (billing starts)
3. **API Ready**: Docker container ready for requests
4. **Processing**: Actively generating videos
5. **Downloading**: Transferring results
6. **Terminating**: Shutting down (billing stops)

---

## üí° Tips for Reading Logs

1. **Setup Time is One-Time**: The ~75s Docker setup happens once per instance, regardless of scenes
2. **Processing Ratio**: Expect ~3 seconds of processing per 1 second of video
3. **Download Speed**: Depends on file size and network, typically 1-2 MB/s
4. **Cost Precision**: Costs are calculated to 6 decimal places for accuracy
5. **Parallel Efficiency**: Best with 5+ scenes per instance to amortize setup time

## üö® Common Issues in Logs

### "Still waiting for API..."
- Normal during Docker startup
- Concern if continues beyond attempt 20

### "Instance not available in zone"
- AWS capacity issue
- Framework automatically tries other zones

### "Download failed"
- Network timeout
- File will be retried or marked as failed

### Cost higher than expected
- Check "Total runtime" - includes all operations
- Setup time is included in cost
- Consider batching more scenes per instance
